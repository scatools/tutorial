Instead this tool was designed to provide data to support conservation planning efforts across the Gulf Coast Region. All users acknowledge that the CPT model is intended to explore ecological and socioeconomic co-benefits of proposed areas of land conservation, and should not be used in a decision making context. The flexibility of this tool enables a user to evaluate conservation alternatives using either a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework, or user-defined values. This book is intended to provide additional support documents for the data measures used in the CPT tool. "],

You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Chuck 2019) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "],
